# SEAstainability

This is the backend for SEAstainability, an app built to show sustainable seafood choices.

## Getting Started/Installing

Fork and clone this repo. First use the command:

```
bundle install
```
to create your Gemfile. Since this is built with PostgreSQL, you will also need to run:

```
rails db:create
```
as well as:

```
rails db:migrate
```
and:
```
rails db:seed
```

To start the rails server, run this command:
```
rails s
```

Next, find my "seafood-frontend" repo to run the frontend file. (https://github.com/alexiscait142/seafood_frontend)

### Prerequisites

This app requires Ruby on Rails, Active Record, and Postgres.
